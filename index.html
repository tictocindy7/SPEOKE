        <pre><span id='0'>Now,</span>    <span id='1'>I don’t know if you’ve been following the news</span>
<span id='2'>but I’ve been keeping my ears open</span>    <span id='3'>and it seems like everyone 
everywhere</span>   <span id='4'>is super-mad about everything</span>   <span id='5'>all   the time.</span>
<span id='6'>I try to stay a little optimistic,</span>   <span id='7'>even though I will admit,</span>
<span id='8'>things are getting pretty sticky.</span>
<span id='9'>Here’s how I try to look at it,</span>    <span id='10'>this is just me,</span> 
<span id='11'>this guy being the president,</span>   <span id='12'>it's like there’s a horse</span>  
<span id='13'>loose in a hospital.</span> 
<span id='14'>It’s like there’s a horse</span>   <span id='15'>loose in a hospital.</span> 
<span id='16'>I think eventually everything’s going to be okay,</span> 
<span id='17'>but I have no idea what’s going to happen next.</span>
<span id='18'>And neither do any of you, and neither do your parents,</span> 
<span id='19'>because there’s a horse</span>    <span id='20'>loose in the hospital.</span> 
<span id='21'>It’s never happened before</span>
<span id='22'>no one knows what the horse is going to do next,</span>
<span id='23'>least of all the horse.</span> 
<span id='24'>He’s never been in a hospital before</span>
<span id='25'>he’s as confused as you are.</span>      <span id='26'>There’s no experts.</span>
<span id='27'>They try to find experts on the news. They’re like,</span>
<span id='28'>“We’re joined now by a man that once saw a bird in the airport.”</span> 
<span id='29'>Get out of here with that shit!</span>
<span id='30'>We’ve all seen a bird in the airport.</span>
<span id='31'>This is a horse</span> 
<span id='32'>loose in a hospital.</span>
<span id='33'>When a horse is loose in a hospital, you got to stay updated.</span> 
<span id='34'>So all day long you walk around,</span> 
<span id='35'>“Oh What’d the horse do what'd the horse do?”</span> 
<span id='36'>The updates,</span>   <span id='37'>they’re not always bad.</span>
<span id='38'>Sometimes they’re just odd.</span> 
<span id='39'>It’ll be like, “The horse used the elevator?”</span> 
<span id='40'>I didn’t know he knew how to do that.</span> 
<span id='41'>The creepiest days are when you don’t hear from the horse at all.</span>  
<span id='42'>You’re down in the operating room like, “Hey, has anyone uh…”</span> 
<span id='43'>“Has anyone heard–”</span> 
<span id='44'>[imitates clopping hooves]</span> 
<span id='45'>Those are those quiet days when people are like,</span>
<span id='46'>“It looks like the horse has finally calmed down.”</span> 
<span id='47'>And then ten seconds later the horse is like,</span> 
<span id='48'>“I’m gonna run towards the baby incubators</span>
<span id='49'>and smash ’em with my hooves. I’ve got nice hooves</span>
<span id='50'>and a long tail, I’m a horse!”</span></pre>
