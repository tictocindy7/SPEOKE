        <pre>Now,    I don’t know if you’ve been following the news
but I’ve been keeping my ears open    and it seems like everyone 
everywhere   is super-mad about everything   all   the time.
I try to stay a little optimistic,   even though I will admit,
things are getting pretty sticky. 
Here’s how I try to look at it,    and this is just me, 
this guy being the president,   it’s like there’s a horse  
loose in a hospital. 
It’s like there’s a horse   loose in a hospital. 
I think eventually everything’s going to be okay, 
but I have no idea what’s going     to happen next. 
And neither do any of you, and neither do your parents, 
because there’s a horse    loose in the hospital. 
It’s never happened before
no one knows what the horse is going to do next,
least of all the horse. 
He’s never been in a hospital before
he’s as confused as you are.      There’s no experts.
They try to find experts on the news. They’re like, 
“We’re joined now by a man that once saw a bird in the airport.” 
Get out of here with that shit! 
We’ve all seen a bird in the airport. 
This is a horse 
loose in a hospital. 
When a horse is loose in a hospital, you got to stay updated. 
So all day long you walk around, 
“Oh What’d the horse do what'd the horse do?” 
The updates,   they’re not always bad. 
Sometimes     they’re just odd. 
It’ll be like, “The horse used the elevator?” 
I didn’t know he knew how to do that. 
The creepiest days are when you don’t hear from the horse at all.  
You’re down in the operating room like, “Hey, has anyone uh…” 
“Has anyone heard–” 
[imitates clopping hooves] 
Those are those quiet days when people are like,
“It looks like the horse has finally calmed down.” 
And then ten seconds later the horse is like, 
“I’m gonna run towards the baby incubators 
and smash ’em with my hooves. I’ve got nice hooves
and a long tail, I’m a horse!”
And it's like AW That’s what I thought you’d say,
you dumb fucking horse. And then
Then     Then you go to brunch with people and they’re like,
“There shouldn’t be a horse in the hospital.” 
And it’s like,     “We’re well past that.” 
Then other people are like, 
“If there’s gonna be a horse in the hospital, 
I’m going to say the N-word on TV.” 
And those don’t match up at all.
And then for a second 
it seemed like maybe we could survive the horse,
and then 5,000 miles away a hippo was like,
“I have a nuclear bomb and I’m going to blow up the hospital!”
And before we could say anything the horse was like
“If you even fucking look at the hospital,
I will stomp you to death with my hooves. I dare you to do it.
I want I want you to do it. I want you to do it so I can 
stomp you with my hooves, I’m so fucking crazy.” 
“You think you’re fucking crazy, I’m a fucking hippopotamus.
I live in a fucking lake of mud. 
I’m fucking crazy.
And all of us are like,
"Okay okay okay okay okay okay" 
Like poor Andy Cohen at those goddamn reunions.
“Okay okay okay okay okay okay” 
And then, for a second, we were like, 
“Maybe the horse-catcher will catch the horse.” 
And then the horse is like
“I have fired the horse-catcher.”
He can do that? 
That shouldn’t be allowed no matter who the horse is. 
I don’t remember that in Hamilton.</pre>
